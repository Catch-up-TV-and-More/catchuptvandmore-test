# Catch-up TV & More test script

## Introduction

The purpose of this script is multiple:

* Run the plugin outsite Kodi and navigate in the different menus
* Easily custimize the add-on settings
* Configure a preset menu selections
* Launch an in-depth exploration of all menu and sub-menus of the add-on *(soon)*


## How it works?

This module works without modifying the original Catch-up TV & More source code. Thereby you can develop the add-on and test it at the same time in Kodi and in your terminal with this test module.
The different Kodi modules (xbmc, xbmcgui, xbmcaddon and xbmcplugin) are "hooked" with the aid of the mock python module.

## How to do?

Just clone this repository, edit the `config.py` file according to your configuration and run the main file with the `python3 main.py` command.
